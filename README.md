# AI, ML, and DL Glossary

Welcome to the AI, ML, and DL Glossary repository! This repository contains all the general terms used in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I will update this repo from time to time and try my best to cover each term with real-life examples.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository provides descriptions for each term in two formats: 
1. For technical individuals.
2. For non-technical individuals.

Each term also includes a real-life example to help understand its application.

## Example Terms

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Technical Description:**
- Definition: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.
- Example: An AI system like IBM's Watson can analyze and interpret large amounts of data to assist in decision-making processes in fields like healthcare, finance, and customer service.

**Non-Technical Description:**
- Definition: AI refers to machines or software that can think and learn like humans. They can solve problems, understand language, and make decisions.
- Example: A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa can understand your voice commands and help you perform tasks like setting reminders, playing music, or searching for information online.

### Machine Learning (ML)

**Technical Description:**
- Definition: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.
- Example: A machine learning algorithm might be used to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in transaction data.

**Non-Technical Description:**
- Definition: ML is a way for computers to learn from experience and improve their performance over time, just like how humans learn new skills through practice.
- Example: When you use email, ML helps filter out spam by learning from past emails marked as spam and recognizing similar patterns.

### Deep Learning (DL)

**Technical Description:**
- Definition: Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large amounts of data. DL is particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.
- Example: A deep learning model can be used to identify objects in images, such as distinguishing between cats and dogs with high accuracy.

**Non-Technical Description:**
- Definition: DL is an advanced type of machine learning that uses networks of algorithms inspired by the human brain. It can learn to recognize patterns and make decisions based on large amounts of data.
- Example: Facial recognition technology in smartphones uses DL to recognize your face and unlock the device.
